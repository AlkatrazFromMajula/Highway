# Highway
This is the second project in my series of little educational projects. In Highway I've used a fresh learned technique,
establishing project's architecture with scriptable objects. I love flexibility, modularity and autonomy that scriptable objects
bring to workflow, so I've decided to dedicate the whole project to mastering this programming pattern. The game itself is
very simple and relaxing, pared with addictive gameplay loop Highway may steal couple of hours of your time in the same way 
instagram reels or youtube shorts do.

In case you wish to try it out, open OUTDOORS SCENE, then press Play and you're good to go.
