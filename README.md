# Highway

This is the second project in my series of little educational projects. In Highway I've used a fresh learned technique,
establishing project's architecture with scriptable objects. I love flexibility, modularity and autonomy that scriptable objects
bring to workflow, so I've decided to dedicate the whole project to mastering this programming pattern. 

Another direction of study in this project was Spline package. Project's functionality is fully built upon traversing, changing 
and building new splines. I believe that in development process I've got a pretty deep understanding of how splines work in Unity.

The game itself is very simple and relaxing, pared with addictive gameplay loop Highway may steal couple of hours of your time in 
the same way instagram reels or youtube shorts do. 

In my next project I'm going to focus on learning some advanced UI techniques, exploring particle systems and VFX graphs, animating 
a humanoid creature as well as on creating truly interesting and intense gameplay.

In case you wish to try it out, open OUTDOORS SCENE, then press Play and you're good to go.
